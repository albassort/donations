# AVX-512 Community Docs

Hello, quick update here!

I made a small repository for the AVX-512 instruction sets. I didn't like the Intel docs so I made a program to compile it into the `RST` format, and compile it into documentation with `Sphinx`.

You can find the [repository here](https://github.com/albassort/AVX-512-reST-community-docs) and the [documentation here](https://albassort.github.io/AVX-512-reST-community-docs/).
