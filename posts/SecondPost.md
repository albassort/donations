# Hi!

I have a few ideas for this page:
## Searching
  - You should be able to order by date, and post ideas
  - FTS5 table
  - Ideally, you should be able to see where your desired match in each post. This wasn't a feature in my One Piece Searching app, and it should be one here, I think
  - Hide posts
  - Only show 5 posts at a time, and click to see more
  - Search by both titles and bodies
## Donations
  - A dedicated featured page, for donations should they occur
  - Leaderboard, for each coin, when applicable
  - Maybe a most recent donations page

Not sure, just a few ideas. Its very cool, the sky is the limit.

I have an idea for a youtube channel, this may happen. If so, you'll see it here.

Thanks for reading!
