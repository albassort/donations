# A big year to come!
## Hello.

Long time no update, eh?
I turned 22 years old, and I am unsatisfied with 2024-2025 for me. I didn't get enough done, I didn't have enough works. This is, in my view, primarily due to anxiety, and distractions. Yes this year was quite social for me, but, for me, social activity is oft fleeting and immaterial. Yes, I should have been working. I wish to make this year more concrete. So, I am laying out **concrete** goals for the next 365 days.

### Short term AlbaBuild.Nvim, QestKakeGoto, AlbaBTCPay

- QestKakeGoto
    - This is a gambling site I fully implemented. It has automatic scraping for Lol and CS2, automatically generating matches for these. It has animations and a lot of features. This will be fully released soon, though I started development in january, and ended in April.
    - I do, partially, regret working on this. My passion is far closer to the metal than web development. I don't think I will willingly develop a large webiste for fun, ever again.
- AlbaBTCPay
    - I implemented BTC transaction code for QKG (officially named Teahouse Bets). This code was removed in the release version, and, I have implemented it in AlbaBTCPay. This will be a docker contained fully programmable notifier, transaction creater, invoice payer, for Lightning and BTCCore. This is mostly finished, it just requires a steadfast will, and this will be finished
- [AlbaBuild.nvim](https://github.com/albassort/AlbaBuild.nvim)
    - This is already finished, and can be found by clicking above!
    - 2 Youtube videos were made for it, and I intend on extensive youtube documentation for QestKakeGoto as it is a very visual thing that may be difficult to host properly.

### long Term: I have many interesting projects

Stay tuned for more. I don't want to say too much, but, I intend on publishing my next project in a linguistic and/or computational computer science journal. I am very excited to being working on this project. 

### A blog?
There is a chance, during my next project, I will maintain a large blog of ongoing events. It will either be published with the journal, ongoing, but, I like to keep my big projects hidden as I work. I apologize for this but, what can be done? 

If a blog is maintained, it will be rigorous, detailed, and fun to read. I hope to announce it here, should it happen. 

### Poems? 

In addition to a blog, I am going to most likely make a site for my poems. I would, encase of anything happening to me, data-loss, etc, be capable of distributing my poems. Since, as of yet, have no published them, putting them freely on the internet may make sense. Thus, there *may* be a poem portion of the site implemented in the near future, should I get over the fear of them being stolen from me haha.

### Thank you!

Reading is hard, I appreciate you.
