# Hello, world

I have made a little post / update system. My own, completely independent platform, I suppose one could say --- where I am only limited by bandwidth haha. In addition, I've made this webpage like 50x heavier by bundling sql.js, in order to have a flexible, serverless, system for people to serve posts, oops.

I'd like to move to svelte however svelte has made developing and deploying SPA applications, without sveltekit, functionally impossible, or a complete pain in the ass.
