# Hello, world

Hello, all that may see this. I have added a posts feature, and moved this page to Svelte (with the help of Vite!). Additionally, I have increased the payload size of the page by something like 100x, but such is life. 

The page was originally written in simply an index.html file, but I recognize that would be hard to maintain in the long term, especially as I wished to add the posts.

Additionally, I have released the source, now that the source isn't easily accessible by inspect element.
